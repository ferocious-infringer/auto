# Automation modules
# The main purpose of this data pack is to bring the features from its predecessor while at the same time emphasising on performance.
# It is really important to carefully select the design and principles of how the data pack is written to not compromise any performance. Not to mention redundant effort that the game has to do that is caused by poorly thought out and poorly optimised code.
# Please make sure to not just the job done, but is well done.
# Do not leave any code that can be done better ignored. Always make the best and conscious effort to optimise them to the fullest potential.
# Since Minecraft's commands are not pure programming language, an extra stretch of effort needs to be invested to achieve what otherwise is a simple task on traditional programming efficiently in Minecraft.
# It is better to overly thought the way things are and will be done. Because we need to work at the bleeding edge line, to optimize the most performance.
# Good luck!
